This basic template handles some of the most annoying things to figure out when building a web-page.
#1 - Non-resisable header
#2 - Footer that sticks to the bottom of the screen - but is not always visible
#3 - Nav Bar
#4 - Mobile Nav bar with pop-out side menu

This entire page uses absolutely 0 JavaScript to make the navbar and the mobile navbar work!
